 - Discussed security models


 - Discussed configuration template editor
  - Make simple implementation
  - Pick up pace

 - Discussed NetConf vs CLI
  - Try to focus on NetConf since its an open 
    standard and more general use case
  - CLI may be an option later
  - Put in Paper: Issues had with NetConf e.g. libraries etc.

 - Demonstrate functionality in real-world test environment

 - Demonstrate some solution but also show what didn't work and what was tried.



Next Steps

 - Device Context Provider + Configuration Template Editor
 - Report: Current State + Requirements Analysis
