	abstract = {The {MPEG}-{DASH} streaming video standard contains an information leak: even if the stream is encrypted, the segmentation prescribed by the standard causes contentdependent packet bursts. We show that many video streams are uniquely characterized by their burst patterns, and classiﬁers based on convolutional neural networks can accurately identify these patterns given very coarse network measurements. We demonstrate that this attack can be performed even by a Web attacker who does not directly observe the stream, e.g., a {JavaScript} ad conﬁned in a Web browser on a nearby machine.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing use of mobile devices and apps to view copyright protected content (e.g. movies) on the go, digital rights management ({DRM}) protections have primarily been used to protect the digital intellectual property and control their distribution and usage on mobile devices. Unsurprisingly, attackers have sought to circumvent or bypass {DRM} control in order to obtain unauthorised access to copyrighted content. Given the ongoing and rapidly changing nature of mobile device technologies, it is essential for {DRM} protection designer to have an in-depth understanding of an attacker's capabilities and the potential attack vectors (e.g. vulnerabilities that can be exploited to bypass {DRM} protection). In this paper, we propose an adversary model that formalizes the real world capabilities of a {DRM} attacker targeting Apple {iOS} devices. We then demonstrate its utility using four Video-on-Demand ({VoD}) apps, one live {TV} app, and a security {DRM} protection module. To avoid similar structural mistakes in future designs, we outline two recommendations.},

While any algorithm published undergoes some more or less strict experimental security analysis, many of those schemes are being broken in subsequent publications. In this paper, we show that two main motivations for preferring chaos-based image encryption over classical strong cryptographic encryption, namely computational effort and security benefits, are highly questionable. We demonstrate that several statistical tests, commonly used to assess the security of chaos-based encryption schemes, are insufficient metrics for security analysis. We do this experimentally by constructing obviously insecure encryption schemes and demonstrating that they perform well and/or pass several of these tests. In conclusion, these tests can only give a necessary, but by no means a sufficient condition for security. As a consequence of this paper, several security analyses in related work are questionable; further, methodologies for the security assessment for chaos based encryption schemes need to be entirely reconsidered.},

The functional model describes the different functions of a system and the interactions between them. The transactional model defines the chaining of exchanged messages, of their steps. The architectural model maps the different elements of a system to actual principals such as servers, storage units, and devices.

	abstract = {In Chap. 2, we built the case as to why digital video should be protected. Creating movies and {TV} shows is expensive. The cost of creating them is constantly increasing. The creators and investors expect a fair return on investment. Traditionally, copyright laws have provided an incentive to create with the promise of fair reward. Unfortunately, content digitalization has drastically facilitated piracy, online or in other forms. Although digitalization generates serious cost reduction for production and distribution, the incentive to invest proposed under the umbrella of copyright is in danger. The first aim of content protection may be to enforce fair reward by addressing digital piracy. Analog cultural goods often were offered in versioned packages. A song could be packaged in an album on 33 {RPM} {LP} records or audio tapes or as a single song on a 45 {RPM} {LP} record. Digital goods could easily offer such versioning if there were a way to create excludability. This is the second aim of video content protection. Furthermore, it is paramount for video content to be protected before its official release date: an early leak represents serious losses for content owners; hence, the B2B business needs efficient content protection solutions. Unfortunately, current solutions sometimes introduce severe restrictions on the use of digital goods. Consumers, being used to user-friendly analog goods, sometimes feel that these digital goods’ restrictions are unfair and unnecessary. This resentment can be loudly expressed. In retaliation, some consumers have deferred to alternate unauthorized sources of digital goods that do not impose usage limitations. This is increasingly putting at risk digital distribution.},

Conventional encryption methods are based on lengthy keys and higher number of rounds which are inefficient for low powered, small battery operated devices. Motivated by the success of lightweight encryption methods specially designed for {IoT} environment, herein an efficient method for video encryption is proposed. The proposed technique is based on a recently proposed encryption algorithm named Secure {IoT} ({SIT}), which utilizes P and Q functions of the {KHAZAD} cipher to achieve high encryption at low computation cost. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method and results are compared with Secure Force ({SF}-64) cipher.

Interactive applications can be signaled and transported using the widely deployed Hybrid Broadcast Broadband Television ({HbbTV}) standard. The {DVB} and {HbbTV} standards, however, lack mandatory authentication and integrity mechanisms for the transmitted data. This allows a remote attacker to replace legitimate broadcasts by overpowering the regular radio signal. The attacker-controlled signal can then deliver, e.g., a malicious {HbbTV} application, which in turn can be used to exploit local security vulnerabilities on Smart {TVs} ({STV}) in range. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to practically demonstrate that modern {STVs} can be compromised remotely by malware transmitted over-the-air using {DVB} systems. A proof-of-concept and several experiments are developed to assess important real-world properties of {DVB}-assisted attacks. New results on the reach of such an attack and its detectability are presented, which are used to propose an efficient protection scheme to secure existing and future {HbbTV}-enabled receivers.},

	abstract = {Over-the-top ({OTT}) media delivery or internet video streaming subscription services like Netflix and Amazon have become highly successful. Broadcasters and telecommunication companies are increasingly investing in creating video streaming platforms. This paper gives an overview of current media streaming and content protection standards. One of the main challenges for commercial content providers is to stream to as many devices (mobile, desktop, {TV}, etc.) as possible. Standards such as {MPEG}-{DASH} or {HLS} and related standards help to achieve this in an efficient and interoperable way. On the device side, different application platforms exist with different playback models. In order to distribute premium content, Digital Rights Management ({DRM}) systems are needed to protect the media streams. Using only one {DRM} system to protect the content is not enough to reach all relevant devices, because a platform or device is usually tied to the vendor's {DRM}. As a result, a multi-{DRM} ecosystem is needed for {OTT} delivery in order to protect content with more than one {DRM} system - the {MPEG} Common Encryption ({CENC}) standard enables this. In a multi-{DRM} backend, different entities exist that exchange sensitive metadata such as {DRM}-specific information and encryption keys. This communication can be interoperable following the Content Protection Information Exchange Format ({CPIX}) specification by the {DASH}-{IF}.},

To bridge the gaps, we suggest specific improvements in cloud ingest, signal processing, and transcoding stacks. Cloud playout is also identified as critically needed technology for convergence. Finally, based on all such considerations, we offer sketches of several possible hybrid architectures, with different degrees of offloading of processing in cloud, that are likely to emerge in the future.},

The emergence of segment-based {HTTP} distribution protocols has produced unforeseen issues in existing content delivery workflows. Support for over-the-top ({OTT}) delivery has further complicated {DRM} enforcement. In this paper we analyze the impact of segmented {OTT} delivery on traditional content preparation and distribution workflows. We discuss the use of pipelining for optimizing transcoding, segmentation, and encryption workflows. We also address security and scalability concerns related to key generation, device registration, and key distribution workflows.

Our first construction is selectively secure against chosen-plaintext attack, whereas the second one achieves adaptive security which is the strongest security model in the broadcast setting. Besides, our second construction is dynamic, whereas none of the existing {MCBE} constructions supports the dynamic property. Moreover, our second {MCBE} construction is the first inclusive-exclusive {MCBE} construction, where the broadcaster can reduce the encryption and decryption cost by choosing the smallest set between the set of subscribes and revoked users in the encryption and decryption phase respectively.},

	abstract = {Public key broadcast encryption is a cryptographic method to securely transmit a message from anyone to a group of receivers such that only privileged users can decrypt it. A secure multicast system allows a user to send a message to a dynamically changing group of users. The secure multicast can be realized by the broadcast encryption. In this paper, we propose a novel combinatorial subset difference ({CSD}) public key broadcast encryption algorithm which allows a generalized subset different representation in which wildcards can be placed at any position. The proposed {CSD} is applicable to a secure multicast as well as minimizes the header size compared with existing public key broadcast encryption schemes without sacrificing key storage and encryption/decryption performance. Experimental results show that the proposed {CSD} scheme not only reduces the ciphertext header size by 17\% and 31\% but also improves encryption performance (per subset) by 6 and 1.3 times, and decryption performance by 10 and 19 times compared with existing efficient subset difference ({SD}) and interval schemes, respectively. Furthermore, especially for subsets represented in a non-hierarchical manner, the proposed {CSD} reduces the number of subsets by a factor of 1000 times compared with {SD} and interval approaches. We prove semantic security of our proposed {CSD} scheme under l-{BDHE} assumption without the random oracle model.},

	abstract = {In today’s Internet era, group communications in multimedia applications are becoming more and more popular. The issues of controlling illegal access to multimedia contents require efficient and secure mechanisms for distribution of common key called scrambling key or group key. In order to provide secure delivery of multimedia contents in digital pay-{TV} systems, a large number of keying information messages are exchanged for group key/scrambling key updates in the traditional key distribution schemes. In this paper we propose a Chinese Remainder Theorem ({CRT}) based key distribution protocol which is highly secure and computationally efficient. The proposed protocol, 1) has drastically reduced the computational complexity of Group Manager ({GM}) and members for updating the keys, 2) has greatly increased the security by using an additional secret parameter at Group Manager and members areas, 3) can efficiently handle large and dynamically updating groups and, 4) can update the group key in one message, without updating member’s key. With our proposed key distribution scheme, only legal members can access the multimedia contents correctly and the illegal access can be prevented. The proposed scheme is applicable in Conditional Access System ({CAS}) of digital pay-{TV} systems without increasing storage and communication overheads on {GM} and members. The comparative analysis of our proposed scheme with existing schemes in terms of computational cost assures the effectiveness of our scheme. As a proof of concept, we implement our scheme to a decentralized architecture-based key management system and demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity.},

This project proposes a new key management paradigm which a combination of traditional broadcast encryption and group key agreement which never reveals the group dynamic information to outsiders and achieves both forward secrecy and backward secrecy. It provides a secure key management model not only with public and private key but also two more keys called group key and session key. It is distributed to multiple user overtime. It also overcomes the limitation of quantum point to point key sharing. It offers reliability and convenience of use, as well as to introduce a secure and efficient key management technique for any quantum cryptography network in real time.},

This necessitates secure video encryption algorithms suitable for multimedia application because of the large data size and real time constraint. Conventional encryption algorithms are designed for generic data, and as such, it does not support many specific video application requirements. In the paper we propose a computationally efficient and secure video encryption algorithm that makes encryption feasible for real-time applications without heavy computational overhead and reduces key management by utilizing block shuffling technique. Block Shuffling based video encryption with Faro {IN} {OUT} Shuffle and rotation, i.e., first image is rotated by an angle then key is generated based Block size using Faro {IN} {OUT} perfect shuffle which is a perfect shuffling algorithm which is isomorphic to random permutation. we will show that our proposed method provide more scrambling of image then random permutation and no need to maintain long key file.},

Unlike a desktop application, a web application is split into browser-side and server-side components. A subset of the application’s internal information flows are inevitably exposed on the network. We show that despite encryption, such a side-channel information leak is a realistic and serious threat to user privacy. Specifically, we found that surprisingly detailed sensitive information is being leaked out from a number of high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search: an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, her family income and investment secrets, despite {HTTPS} protection; a stranger on the street can glean enterprise employees' web search queries, despite {WPA}/{WPA}2 Wi-Fi encryption. More importantly, the root causes of the problem are some fundamental characteristics of web applications: stateful communication, low entropy input for better interaction, and significant traffic distinctions. As a result, the scope of the problem seems industry-wide. We further present a concrete analysis to demonstrate the challenges of mitigating such a threat, which points to the necessity of a disciplined engineering practice for side-channel mitigations in future web application developments.},

	abstract = {Content-centric networking ({CCN}) project, a flavor of information-centric networking ({ICN}), decouples data from its source by shifting the emphasis from hosts and interfaces to information. As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining content confidentiality and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques similar to those used in modern digital rights management ({DRM}) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content. In this paper, we present a secure content distribution architecture for {CCN} that is based on proxy re-encryption. Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval. Unlike widely-deployed solutions, our solution is also capable of utilizing the opportunistic in-network caches in {CCN}. We also experimentally compare two proxy re-encryption schemes that can be used to implement the architecture, and describe the proof of concept application we developed over {CCNx}.},

	abstract = {Dieser Artikel erläutert den Trustworthy Computing Security Development Lifecycle ({SDL} – Entwicklungszyklus für vertrauenswürdigen Computereinsatz). Diesen Prozess hat Microsoft für die Entwicklung von Software übernommen, die böswilligen Angriffen standhalten muss. Er erweitert die Phasen der Softwareentwicklung bei Microsoft um mehrere auf Sicherheit abzielende Aktivitäten und Projektergebnisse. Zu diesen Aktivitäten und Projektergebnissen zählen die Entwicklung von Bedrohungsmodellen beim Softwareentwurf, die Verwendung von Tools zur statischen Codeanalyse bei der Implementierung sowie das Durchführen von Codeüberprüfungen und Sicherheitstests bei einer gezielten Suche nach Sicherheitsmängeln ("Security Push" – Sicherheitsinitiative). Vor der Veröffentlichung einer nach dem {SDL} entwickelten Software muss diese eine abschließende Sicherheitsüberprüfung ({FSR} – Final Security Review) durchlaufen, die von einem von der Entwicklungsgruppe unabhängigen Team durchgeführt wird. Im Vergleich zwischen mit bzw. ohne {SDL} entwickelter Software wurden in {SDL}-Software wesentlich weniger Sicherheitslücken entdeckt. In diesem Artikel wird der {SDL} erläutert und von Erfahrungen bei der Entwicklung von Microsoft-Software nach dem {SDL} berichtet. Dieser Artikel enthält auch Links zu englischsprachigen Seiten.

	abstract = {This paper deﬁnes and maps all possible threats to broadcasting services. Viewers currently use various types of broadcasting services—including cable {TV}, {IPTV}, and mobile {TV}, among others—and broadcast business operators are now developing the appropriate security mechanisms for each medium to safely and reliably provide broadcasting services to their audiences. Unlike mobile {TV}, which uses of a public network as in an over-the-top conﬁguration, cable {TV} and {IPTV} are basically closed networks in terms of network security. However, they also link with external networks to provide additional services (bidirectional services or commerce-related services). Therefore, broadcast business operators of with various types of broadcast media are susceptible to security threats from which their broadcasting services may come to a halt or may be abused by hackers, such as with well-developed {APT} attacks, as well as other common external attacks. The common vulnerability scoring system for {IT} security is used to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the risk to security threats for broadcasting services. We also derive the results of a penetration test for the {STB} through the results presented with respect to a security threat. This result will help address potential security vulnerabilities in broadcasting services.},

Conventional encryption techniques are not appropriate for securing multimedia systems given the need to encrypt a large amount of data in real-time. This paper presents a selective video encryption algorithm that utilizes multiple stream ciphers and a unique multi-key mechanism to improve security while maintaining efficiency and format compliance. Furthermore, the algorithm is well suited for parallel hardware implementation. Finally, experimental results from the encryption of various test video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the video encryption scheme.},

Doch die geringe Nachfrage an der {HD}-Ausstrahlung via Satellit zwingt die Sender nun, zurückzurudern und doch länger als geplant in Standard Definition zu senden. Die {RTL}-Gruppe sowie auch {ProSiebenSat}.1 haben die weitere {SD}-Ausstrahlung via Satellit nun auch vertraglich zementiert. Im Video erklären wir Ihnen, wie Sie {HD}-Fernsehen in Zukunft empfangen können.},

	abstract = {Ein Universally Unique Identifier ({UUID}) ist eine 128-Bit-Zahl, welche zur Identifikation von Informationen  in Computersystemen  verwendet wird. Der Ausdruck Globally Unique Identifier ({GUID}) wird ebenfalls benutzt, typischerweise im Zusammenhang mit Microsoft (z. B. Software, Registry).
Bei der Generierung nach den Standardmethoden können {UUIDs} für praktische Zwecke als global eindeutig angenommen werden. Obwohl die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein {UUID} dupliziert wird, nicht null ist, ist sie so gering, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Kollision zumeist vernachlässigbar ist. Ein Vorteil von {UUIDs} ist die – im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Nummerierungsschemata – Unabhängigkeit von einer zentralen Registrierungsstelle oder Koordinierung zwischen den Parteien.
Daher kann jeder einen {UUID} erstellen und ihn verwenden, um etwas mit der größtmöglichen Gewissheit zu identifizieren, dass der Bezeichner nicht einen anderen Bezeichner dupliziert, der bereits erstellt wurde oder wird, um etwas anderes zu identifizieren. Informationen, die von unabhängigen Parteien mit {UUIDs} gekennzeichnet wurden, können daher später in einer einzigen Datenbank zusammengefasst oder auf demselben Kanal mit einer vernachlässigbaren Wahrscheinlichkeit von Duplikaten übertragen werden.
Die Verwendung von {UUIDs} und {GUIDs} ist weit verbreitet. Viele Computerplattformen bieten Unterstützung beim Generieren und Parsen ihrer Textdarstellung.
Er wurde von der Open Software Foundation ({OSF}) als Teil des Distributed Computing Environment ({DCE}) standardisiert und ist jetzt in {RFC} 4122 geregelt.
Ein {UUID} besteht aus einer 16-Byte-Zahl, die hexadezimal notiert und in fünf Gruppen unterteilt wird. In ihrer Normalform sieht ein {UUID} beispielsweise so aus:
