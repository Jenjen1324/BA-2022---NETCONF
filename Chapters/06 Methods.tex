To gain knowledge and an understanding of the subject, literature was researched and
the Init7 network engineering team was questioned. As only a
prototype was created to the feasability, a waterfall-like structure was used for
the planning of the implementation.

\section{Literature Research Method}

While documentation regarding standardized network protocols is fairly easy to find,
research specific to configuration managament is rather limited, because solutions
mostly exist in an enterprise context.



\subsection{}




- Lots of papers on protocols
- Difficulty in finding concrete cases
- Lots of stuff is propiritary
  - Open Source solutions are very fragemented
  - Makes it hard to find examples for working solutions
