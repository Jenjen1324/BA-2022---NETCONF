\section{Code Snippets}

Please note that all NETCONF configuration snippets are a heavily reduced
and modified version of the configuration running in production.
This is in part because the actual configuration is intellectual property of Init7
but also because of the enormous potential for damage if security issues are
identified by bad actors.
