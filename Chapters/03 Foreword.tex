This bachelor thesis was written as part of our part-time studies in computer 
science at the ZHAW School of Engineering in Winterthur. 
The idea for this thesis came from Jens Vogler, who works part-time at Init7 (Switzerland) AG 
as the software engineering team lead. 

The topic of this thesis was already in discussion within Init7 and the opportunity
to write a thesis presented itself.
The work was supervised by Dr. Gürkan Gür. He works at the ZHAW in the research area Information Security
and as a lecturer for IT security. 
We would like to thank him for his support during our work and his flexibility, 
especially during stressful times as the sudden change to a leadership position within Init7
presented challenges which were not anticipated. 
We would also like to thank Sam Aschwanden, Lino De Moragon, Thomas Fritz, Pascal Gloor and the
rest of the Init7 network engineering team. 
They all provided valuable inputs and help throughout the thesis.
