End-to-end network service requirements can be on connectivity, security, performance and faulttolerance. However, there is a large conceptual gap between end-to-end requirements and detailed component configurations. To bridge this gap, a number of subsidiary requirements are created that constrain, for example, the protocols to be used, and the logical structures and associated policies to be set up at different protocol layers.},

	abstract = {Configuration and traffic management for reconfigurable networks is investigated. Such networks have the potential to adapt well to changing traffic patterns and to failure of physical facilities. The authors define the underlying constrained optimization problem in general, and apply a heuristic technique to a simple case to illustrate the benefit of reconfiguring the logical network. It is found that reconfiguration results in substantial improvements in the blocking performance of the network when it is subjected to uneven loading. The authors compare and contrast reconfiguration with a dynamic alternate routing scheme, concluding that the two techniques together provide the best performance. Technology and systems issues relevant to managing such reconfigurable networks are discussed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Over the past few years, much effort has been given to improve the deficiencies of {SNMP}, but most have failed to be standardized. One critical deficiency of {SNMP} is in the area of configuration management. Recent work focuses on the use of {XML} technology for network and service management as an alternative or complementary approach to {SNMP}. This article presents the {IETF}'s latest effort, Netconf, which is viewed by many as a promising revolutionary solution for configuration management. To validate this new effort, we present the design and implementation of an {XML}-based configuration management system based on Netconf. We also discuss our experience with {XCMS} and make some suggestions for improving the current Netconf protocol.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances in the telecommunications industry have led to discovering the limitations of traditional communication networks and, in this context, to the emergence of a new paradigm that tries to mitigate them, namely Software Defined Networking ({SDN}). When it appeared, it was associated only with the {OpenFlow} protocol, as a southbound interface. However, the recent trend in the industry is the adoption of {NETCONF} (Network Configuration) protocol, not for replacing {OpenFlow}, but rather as a complementary solution. This paper provides a comparison, based on hands-on experimentation, between three {NETCONF} Server open source implementations: Netopeer, {OpenYuma} and Netconf Testtool provided by Opendaylight. The objective of the paper is to help the researchers interested in developing or testing {SDN} applications that use the {NETCONF} protocol as an interface between the {SDN} controller and the network elements choose a framework for a {NETCONF} Server that is suited to their needs.},

	abstract = {The essential changes that have taken place over the past decade in the ﬁeld of telecommunications present new requirements for the educational institutions laboratory complexes management. The modern management concept “Infrastructure as Code” (Infrastructure as Code, {IaC}) proclaims the usage of a single and universal approach for programmatic management of all components of the communication and computing infrastructure. One of the most common ways to implement this approach is based on the representation of managed unit’s conﬁgurations in the form of specially marked-up records that form the conﬁguration management database. In this case, process of infrastructure components control is nothing more then sequence of transactions that can be performed for this database records, both locally or remotely - by using network management protocols. The implementation of solutions based on modern universal protocols and network management tools will be complicated when the controlled components do not support modern network management protocols and are separated by the institution’s intranet. As one of the possible approaches to solving these problems, we consider the use of gateway communication servers as part of the training classes, which will be able to implement dynamic conﬁguration management of special laboratory equipment of the training class and to provide information interaction between the components of the laboratory complex. The paper considers the choice of control protocols for the gateway server, as well as tools for managing communication infrastructures, and presents an implementation option for this approach for integrating special laboratory equipment of the {IRIT} {RTF} at Ural Federal University laboratory classes into a single softwaredeﬁned laboratory complex.},
