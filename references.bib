	abstract = {As the Internet continues to grow, the tasks of operations and management of IP networks and systems are becoming more difficult. Over the past few years, much effort has been given to improve the deficiencies of SNMP, but most have failed to be standardized. One critical deficiency of SNMP is in the area of configuration management. Recent work focuses on the use of XML technology for network and service management as an alternative or complementary approach to SNMP. This article presents the IETF's latest effort, Netconf, which is viewed by many as a promising revolutionary solution for configuration management. To validate this new effort, we present the design and implementation of an XML-based configuration management system based on Netconf. We also discuss our experience with XCMS and make some suggestions for improving the current Netconf protocol.},

	abstract = {Configuration and traffic management for reconfigurable networks is investigated. Such networks have the potential to adapt well to changing traffic patterns and to failure of physical facilities. The authors define the underlying constrained optimization problem in general, and apply a heuristic technique to a simple case to illustrate the benefit of reconfiguring the logical network. It is found that reconfiguration results in substantial improvements in the blocking performance of the network when it is subjected to uneven loading. The authors compare and contrast reconfiguration with a dynamic alternate routing scheme, concluding that the two techniques together provide the best performance. Technology and systems issues relevant to managing such reconfigurable networks are discussed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

End-to-end network service requirements can be on connectivity, security, performance and faulttolerance. However, there is a large conceptual gap between end-to-end requirements and detailed component configurations. To bridge this gap, a number of subsidiary requirements are created that constrain, for example, the protocols to be used, and the logical structures and associated policies to be set up at different protocol layers.},
